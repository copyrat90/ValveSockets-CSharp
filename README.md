# ValveSockets-CSharp

This repository provides (mostly) auto-generated C# bindings for [GameNetworkingSockets](https://github.com/ValveSoftware/GameNetworkingSockets) which is a library created and maintained by [Valve Software](https://www.valvesoftware.com).

The project is currently in a very early state and might have some issues.
In its current state it's **not** recommended to use this library for your own projects.

## Credits

- This project started as a fork of [ValveSockets-CSharp](https://github.com/nxrighthere/ValveSockets-CSharp) by [@nxrighthere](https://github.com/nxrighthere), which helped a lot to get a better understanding of the structure of GNS.
